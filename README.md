# Advanced Upload Control (for the WordPress Customizer)

A WordPress Customizer image upload control that uses the media modal to demonstrate building advanced controls.

This is a child theme of Twenty Twelve, which you'll need. Putting this functionality in a theme is for the convenience of demonstration only. Custom controls can be invoked from a theme, but shouldn't be defined in one.
